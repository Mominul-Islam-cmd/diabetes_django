# 🚀 Project Overview

📌 Title: Diabetes Prediction Using KNN and Deployment with Django

🎯 Objective

To predict whether a patient has diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The model will be trained on data sourced from Kaggle and deployed using Django, rendered via a web platform.

📊 Data Source and Preprocessing

📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.
🛠️ Steps:
1.	📥 Load the data: Import the dataset into a Jupyter notebook for preprocessing and model training.
2.	🧹 Preprocess the data:
	
       o	🔍 Handle missing values.
  	
       o	🔄 Encode categorical variables if any.
  	
       o	📏 Scale the features if necessary.

🧠 Model Building and Evaluation

🧮 Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📝 Steps:
1.	🔀 Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2.	🏋️ Train the model: Use the KNN algorithm to train the model on the training set.
3.	📊 Evaluate the model: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

🌐 Deployment with Django

🖥️ Framework: Django for web application deployment.

📝 Steps:
1.	🛠️ Create a Django project: Set up a new Django project and configure the necessary settings.
2.	🏗️ Build the app: Create an app within the Django project for handling predictions.
3.	🔗 Integrate the model: Load the trained KNN model into the Django app to make predictions on user input.
4.	🎨 Create views and templates: Design the front end to allow users to input data and view predictions.
5.	☁️ Deploy using Render: Deploy the Django app using Render for seamless web hosting.
