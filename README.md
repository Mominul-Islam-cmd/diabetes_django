Project Overview
Title: Diabetes Prediction Using KNN and Deployment with Django

Objective: To predict whether a patient has diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The model will be trained on data sourced from Kaggle and deployed using Django, rendered via a web platform.

Data Source and Preprocessing
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

Steps:

Load the data: Import the dataset into a Jupyter notebook for preprocessing and model training.
Preprocess the data:
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables if any.
Scale the features if necessary.
Model Building and Evaluation
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Steps:

Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model: Use the KNN algorithm to train the model on the training set.
Evaluate the model: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment with Django
Framework: Django for web application deployment.

Steps:

Create a Django project: Set up a new Django project and configure the necessary settings.
Build the app: Create an app within the Django project for handling predictions.
Integrate the model: Load the trained KNN model into the Django app to make predictions on user input.
Create views and templates: Design the front end to allow users to input data and view predictions.
Deploy using Render: Deploy the Django app using Render for seamless web hosting
